            <p className="block">I started my career journey in Film/Video. I've enjoyed producing content for screens, big
              and small.
              I'm a storyteller. Web development is my next, new, exciting frontier to continue engaging people with
              stories.</p>
            <p className="block">The full stack interests me, but front-end user experience is my focus. An intuitive
              interface is everything to the user.</p>
            <p className="block">I'm a natural leader, and I play well with others. I have no problem taking the reigns when
              needed or relinquishing
              the spotlight when a teammate is <strong>shining</strong>.</p>
