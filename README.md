## Description

One stop shop to learn about me, my work history and projects, my favorite quote, and contact info. I might even add some pictures of my cats.

## Credits

I used [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)'s open-souce CSS library for the styling. I put it all together in React. I took some inspiration from [this template](https://github.com/BulmaTemplates/bulma-templates/blob/master/templates/personal.html) created by [Muhammad Ubaid Raza](https://mubaidr.js.org). My hero photo was taken by my very good friend [Byron](http://stockyfotos.com/).
